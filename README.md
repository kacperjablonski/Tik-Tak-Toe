<h1> TIK TAK TOE </h1><br>
I made my first javascript program. I learned the syntax and sent the first commit

This is basic game TikTakToe in CLI. There will be two players in a game. Two signs represent each player. The general signs used in the game are X and O. Finally, there will be a board with 9 boxes.<br>
<br>
1  &nbsp&nbsp  |2  &nbsp&nbsp  |3 &nbsp  <br>
----------      <br>
4  &nbsp&nbsp  |5  &nbsp&nbsp  |6 &nbsp  <br>
----------      <br>
7  &nbsp&nbsp  |8  &nbsp&nbsp  |9  &nbsp  <br>
<br>
The gameplay will be as follows.
<br>
First, one user chooses a number between 1 and 9 to place his marker on the field<br>
Then the second user selects a number from 1-9 to place a marker on this field<br>
The goal of the players is to place their respective signs completely row-wise or column-wise, or diagonally.<br>
A user cannot select a field that has already been selected by him or another user. <br>
The game goes on until a player wins the game or it ended up in a draw by filling all boxes without a winning match.<br>
